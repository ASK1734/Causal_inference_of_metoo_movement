    "\n",
    "#### Collection of Stable Search Terms:\n",
    "- An **anchor bank** is a set of search terms that are known to have relatively stable and consistent search volumes over time. These terms serve as a benchmark or reference point.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Normalization Tool:\n",
    "- The purpose of the anchor bank is to provide a way to **normalize Google Trends data**. Google Trends gives search interest data on a relative scale (0 to 100), where 100 represents the peak popularity of the term for the specified region and time period. This relativity makes it difficult to compare different search terms directly or to analyze the same term across different time periods.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Calibration Reference:\n",
    "- By comparing your terms of interest to these anchor terms, you can calibrate the relative search interest data to a more absolute scale. This process allows for more accurate comparisons across different search terms and timeframes.\n"
